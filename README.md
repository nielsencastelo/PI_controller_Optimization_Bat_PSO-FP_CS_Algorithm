# PI_controller_Optimization_Bat_PSO-FP_CS_Algorithm
This  paper  presents  the  modeling  and  computer  simulation of a control system for a shell and tube heat exchanger,  
using  Bat  Algorithms,  Particle  Swarm  Optimization,  Flower  Pollination Algorithm and Cuckoo Search Algorithm. 
To evaluate  the performance of different methods of tuning, we compared the values of the transient of the response to 
step in eight mesh settings  generated. It has also established a comparison between these two  types  of  mesh  using  
the  performance  indices  proposed  in  the  literature, with optimized system by Bat Algorithms got the best  values 
of transient in relation to the Particle Swarm Optimization,  Cuckoo  Search  Algorithm  and  Flower  Pollination  Algorithm.  
Performance indices FPA and PSO obtained better results.
